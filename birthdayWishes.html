        Your the first person raa naa kullu jokes ki navvi nannu encourage chesedhi.....😅 and Your the most matured person in our circle..... <br><br>

        Even when your girlfriend is with us, you still give the same time and priority to our friends. Your relationship never affects the bond we share, and you always make sure that we feel equally valued and important in your life.<br><br>

        Rakesh : You’re incredibly generous, spending on us without a second thought. Whether it’s treating us to a meal 🍽️, buying gifts 🎁, covering expenses 💵, and your bike🏍️ and car🚗 are with us more often than with you, and you always do it selflessly, never expecting anything in return. Your willingness to support and share shows just how caring and generous you truly are.🙌😊<br><br>

        Rakesh : A friend can offer money 💵, fun 🎉, and time ⏰, but along with all these, you gave me something far more valuable: another family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. You provided me with a second set of parents who loved me like their own ❤️, and a sister who looked out for me as if I were her real brother 👩‍❤️‍👨. Not everyone gets this kind of gift, and for that, I am forever grateful 🙏 <br><br>

        I miss you a lot, my friend. When I say I miss you, it means I am missing my own happiness 😔. Without you, the joy I usually experience every day feels incomplete 🌟. The happiness that comes from being with you is something I truly value 💖, and your absence creates a significant void in my life 💔. I feel a large gap every day that only being with you can fill 🌈. Your presence brings immense joy, and your absence is deeply felt 🥺.<br><br>

        We’ve shared a friendship for 12 years, and I’ve treasured 💖 every moment of our time together—our childhood 👶 memories, school days 🏫,  and the countless enjoyable moments at home.</b><br><br>

        When you went to the US after our sister’s marriage, it made me feel so sad 😢 because I didn’t know when you would come back. The uncertainty of your return left me with a heavy heart 💔 and a lingering sense of longing. At that moment, it felt like crying was the only option, but I managed to hold back the tears.<br><br>

        I hope you get a job quickly 🤞 because the sooner you secure one, the sooner you’ll be able to come back to India 🇮🇳. The thought of having you return soon makes me look forward to it even more!<br><br>

        I’m wishing for your bank balance to be as large as your mobile number is long! 😄 It’s my way of hoping for your financial success and prosperity to be just as impressive. Seeing you thrive and achieve great things is something I truly look forward to. <br><br>

        Wishing you a fantastic birthday! 🎂 May your day be filled with joy, celebration, and everything you’ve been dreaming of.<br><br>
        <b> You will always be in my 7 minutes.</b>(Ardhamaindha ee line)<br><br><br>
